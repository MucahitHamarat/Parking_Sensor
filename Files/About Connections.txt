The connections of the LCD are exactly as in the screenshot taken from the Proteus. The contrast of LCD can be changed with 5k ohm.

The VCC pin of the Ultrasonic Sensor is connected to the + tip of the Breadboard, which is supplied with 5v. 
The GND pin is directly connected to the - tip of the same breadboard.

The Trig tip of the ultrasonic sensor is directly connected to the B4 leg of the STM32, 
The Echo pin, on the other hand, goes to GND with 2 x 470 ohm resistors connected in series, and a connection is being made to pin B3 of the 
STM32 from the middle of these 2 resistors.
